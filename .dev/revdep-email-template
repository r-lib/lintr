Hello {maintainer}! Thank you for using {{lintr}} in your package {package}!

{{lintr}} will soon be releasing an update to CRAN -- be sure to check the latest NEWS to get an overview
of the upcoming improvements and bug fixes.

We checked the results of running lint_package() using the CRAN version {old_release} and
the current version in development (commit hash {main_hash}). We do this ourselves because of {{lintr}}'s
position as a developer tool -- normal CRAN revdep checking is not as helpful for detecting breakages.

On your package, lint_package() took {old_duration}s on CRAN vs. {main_duration}s in our latest version. This
includes applying your .lintr config if one is available.

I am also attaching the following, if they exist:

 * Hard breaking changes: any error generated from lint_package() using the latest version, if none existed using {old_release}
 * Soft breaking changes: any warnings generated from lint_package() using the latest version, if none existed using {old_release}
 * Change in linting state: one or two .csv files containing the lints found using one version of {{lintr}}, but not the other

We have given a more-than-cursory glance at these changes and are satisfied they mark an acceptable step forward when
trading off back-compatibility with package quality, as well as improving precision and/or recall of the linters themselves.
Please don't hesitate to reach out if we've missed something, or if you've got other suggestions for further improvements
to {{lintr}}.

Thanks again!
{{lintr}} development team
