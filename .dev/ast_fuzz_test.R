# Fuzz testing for lint consistency
#
# We have often encountered issues where we handle
#   equivalent R constructs inconsistently, e.g.,
#   function(...) should almost always match the same
#   rules as \(...), and '<-' assignment should almost
#   always be equivalent to '='.
#
# Here, we seek to enforce that (under eventual consistency)
#   by randomly altering the contents of files encountered
#   under expect_lint() to swap known equivalencies.

# beware lazy eval: originally tried adding a withr::defer() in each iteration, but

#   evaluated at run-time. So instead keep track of all edits in this object.
# these have to be enabled/disabled at runtime as it's not possible to disentagle which
#   fuzzer caused the error ex-post (and it might be the interaction of >1 at issue).
#   an earlier approach was like the current 'nofuzz' -- just comment out the troublesome
#   tests from being run at all. But that led to a very quickly growing set of tests being
#   skipped totally, which also hid some issues that are surfaced by the current approach.
#   Another idea would be to just leave the enable/disable calls as code in the test suite,
#   but I prefer the current approach of leaving them as comments: (1) it's more consistent
#   with the 'nolint' exclusion system and (2) it doesn't distract the casual reader as much.
