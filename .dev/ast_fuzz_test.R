# Fuzz testing for lint consistency
#
# We have often encountered issues where we handle
#   equivalent R constructs inconsistently, e.g.,
#   function(...) should almost always match the same
#   rules as \(...), and '<-' assignment should almost
#   always be equivalent to '='.
#
# Here, we seek to enforce that (under eventual consistency)
#   by randomly altering the contents of files encountered
#   under expect_lint() to swap known equivalencies.

# beware lazy eval: originally tried adding a withr::defer() in each iteration, but
#   this effectively only runs the last 'defer' expression as the names are only
#   evaluated at run-time. So instead keep track of all edits in this object.
# this approach to implementing 'nofuzz' feels painfully manual, but I couldn't
#   figure out how else to get 'testthat' to give us what we need -- the failures
#   object in the reporter is frustratingly inconsistent in whether the trace
#   exists, and even if it does, we'd have to text-mangle to get the corresponding
#   file names out. Also, the trace 'srcref' happens under keep.source=FALSE,
#   so we lose any associated comments anyway. even that would not solve the issue
#   of getting top-level exclusions done for 'nofuzz start|end' ranges, except
#   maybe if it enabled us to reuse lintr's own exclude() system.
# therefore we take this approach: pass over the test suite first and comment out
#   any tests/units that have been marked 'nofuzz'. restore later. one consequence
#   is there's no support for fuzzer-specific exclusion, e.g. we fully disable
#   the unnecessary_placeholder_linter() tests because |> and _ placeholders differ.
