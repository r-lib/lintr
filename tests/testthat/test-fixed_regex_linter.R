# NB: escaping is confusing. We have to double-escape everything -- the first
#   escape creates a string that will be parse()d, the second escape is normal
#   escaping that would be done in R code. E.g. in "\\\\.", the R code would
#   read like "\\.", but in order to create those two slashes, we need to write
#   "\\\\." in the string here.

# TODO(michaelchirico): one difference for stringr functions vs. base is that

#   str %>% str_replace_all("x$", "y")
#   actually doesn't need fixed(), but the logic now is only looking at "y"
#   since it's the second argument and a non-regex string. Similarly,
#   str %>% str_detect("x")
#   is a false negative. thankfully there appear to be few false positives here

# TODO(michaelchirico): we could in principle build in logic to detect whether
#   perl=TRUE and interpret "regex or not" accordingly. One place
#   up in practice is for '\<', which is a special character in default
#   regex but not in PCRE. Empirically relevant for HTML-related regex e.g. \\<li\\>
