\usage{
expect_not_linter()
}
\description{
\code{\link[testthat:logical-expectations]{testthat::expect_false()}} exists specifically for testing that an output is
\code{FALSE}. \code{\link[testthat:logical-expectations]{testthat::expect_true()}} can also be used for such tests by
negating the output, but it is better to use the tailored function instead.
The reverse is also true -- use \code{expect_false(A)} instead of
\code{expect_true(!A)}.
