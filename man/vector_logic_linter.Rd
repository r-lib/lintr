\title{Enforce usage of scalar logical operators in conditional statements}
\usage{
vector_logic_linter()
}
\description{
Usage of \code{&} in conditional statements is error-prone and inefficient.
\code{condition} in \code{if (condition) expr} must always be length-1, in which
case \code{&&} is to be preferred. Ditto for \code{|} vs. \code{||}.
}
\details{
This linter covers inputs to \verb{if()} and \verb{while()} conditions and to
\code{\link[testthat:logical-expectations]{testthat::expect_true()}} and \code{\link[testthat:logical-expectations]{testthat::expect_false()}}.

Note that because \code{&} and \code{|} are generics, it is possible that
\code{&&} / \code{||} are not perfect substitutes because \code{&} is doing
method dispatch in an incompatible way.

Moreover, be wary of code that may have side effects, most commonly
assignments. Consider \code{if ((a <- foo(x)) | (b <- bar(y))) { ... }}
vs. \code{if ((a <- foo(x)) || (b <- bar(y))) { ... }}. Because \code{||} exits
early, if \code{a} is \code{TRUE},  the second condition will never be evaluated
and \code{b} will not be assigned. Such usage is not allowed by the Tidyverse
style guide, and the code can easily be refactored by pulling the
assignment outside of the condition, so using \code{||} is still preferable.
