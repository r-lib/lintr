\title{Require usage of \code{expect_null} for checking \code{NULL}}
\usage{
expect_null_linter()
}
\description{
Require usage of \code{expect_null(x)} over \code{expect_equal(x, NULL)} and similar
usages.
}
\details{
\code{\link[testthat:expect_null]{testthat::expect_null()}} exists specifically for testing for \code{NULL} objects.
\code{\link[testthat:equality-expectations]{testthat::expect_equal()}}, \code{\link[testthat:equality-expectations]{testthat::expect_identical()}}, and
\code{\link[testthat:logical-expectations]{testthat::expect_true()}} can also be used for such tests,
but it is better to use the tailored function instead.
