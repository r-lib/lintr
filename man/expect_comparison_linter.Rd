\description{
\code{\link[testthat:comparison-expectations]{testthat::expect_gt()}}, \code{\link[testthat:comparison-expectations]{testthat::expect_gte()}}, \code{\link[testthat:comparison-expectations]{testthat::expect_lt()}},
\code{\link[testthat:comparison-expectations]{testthat::expect_lte()}}, and \code{\link[testthat:equality-expectations]{testthat::expect_equal()}} exist specifically
for testing comparisons between two objects. \code{\link[testthat:logical-expectations]{testthat::expect_true()}} can
also be used for such tests, but it is better to use the tailored function
instead.
