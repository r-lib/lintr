\usage{
expect_s3_class_linter()
}
\description{
\code{\link[testthat:inheritance-expectations]{testthat::expect_s3_class()}} exists specifically for testing the class
of S3 objects. \code{\link[testthat:equality-expectations]{testthat::expect_equal()}}, \code{\link[testthat:equality-expectations]{testthat::expect_identical()}},
and \code{\link[testthat:logical-expectations]{testthat::expect_true()}} can also be used for such tests,
but it is better to use the tailored function instead.
