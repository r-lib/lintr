#' Require usage of `expect_false(x)` over `expect_true(!x)`
#'
#' [testthat::expect_false()] exists specifically for testing that an output is
#'   `FALSE`. [testthat::expect_true()] can also be used for such tests by
#'   negating the output, but it is better to use the tailored function instead.
#'   The reverse is also true -- use `expect_false(A)` instead of
#'   `expect_true(!A)`.
