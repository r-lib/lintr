Next, define name new linter. convention suffix linter names _linter. _linter functions function factories return closure actual linting function. define additional parameters useful linter function declaration (see, e.g. assignment_linter), pipe_call_linter requires additional arguments. core linter logic. xpath XPath expression expressions matching discouraged usage. xpath saved inside factory code (opposed inside linter ) efficiency. Often, xpath somewhat complicated / involve assembly code using paste() glue::glue()[^See infix_spaces_linter() example ], case preferable execute code creating linter; cached XPath re-used expression file linter run. Let’s examine XPath bit closely: Taken together, means want match expr nodes preceded %>% infix operator whose first child node name. maps pretty closely description pipe_call_linter looking , subtlety mapping R code ’re used show XML representation. expr nodes particular take practice get accustomed – use plentiful XPath-based linters lintr guide get extra practice2. Note: xml2 implements XPath 1.0, lacks helpful features available XPath 2.0. closure. called source_expression variable contains top level expressions file linted. call Linter() gives closure class ‘linter’ (also guesses name linter; see ?Linter details). raw text expression available source_file$content. However, generally possible implement linters raw text – consider equals_na_linter. just look == NA text file, ’ll generate many false positives, e.g. comments (# note: .na() proper way check == NA) inside character literals (warning(\"use == NA check missingness\")). ’re also likely generate false negatives, example == NA appear different lines! Working around issues using un-parsed text every situation amounts re-implementing parser. Therefore recommended work tokens source_file$parsed_content source_file$xml_parsed_content, tokenized R parser. tokens obtained parse() utils::getParseData() calls done prior calling new linter. getParseData() returns data.frame information source parse tree file linted. list tokens available r-source/src/main/gram.y. source_file$xml_parsed_content uses xmlparsedata::xml_parse_data() convert getParseData() output XML tree, enables writing linter logic XPath, powerful language expressing paths within nested XML data structure. linters lintr built using XPath powerful language computation abstract syntax tree / parse tree. , return early source_expression expression-level object. get_source_expression() returns object parses input file two ways – done expression--expression, contains expressions file. done facilitate caching. Suppose package long source file (e.g., 100s expressions) – rather run linters every expression every time file updated, caching activated lintr run linter expressions changed. Therefore, preferable write expression-level linters whenever possible. Two types exceptions observed lintr (1) several expressions required ensure linter logic applies (e.g., conjunct_test_linter looks consecutive calls stopifnot(), typically appear consecutive expressions) (2) linter logic simple & fast compute, overhead re-running linter low (e.g., single_quotes_linter). cases, use is_lint_level(source_expression, \"file\"). source_expression$xml_parsed_content copied local variable (strictly necessary facilitates debugging). xml2::xml_find_all() used execute XPath particular expression. Keep mind typically possible single expression generate one lint – example, x %>% na.omit %>% sum trigger pipe_call_linter() twice3. Finally, pass matching XML node(s) xml_nodes_to_lints(), returns Lint objects corresponding “bad” usages found source_expression. See ?Lint ?xml_nodes_to_lints details arguments. Note , message lint always , many linters, message customized closely match observed usage. cases, xml_nodes_to_lint() can conveniently accept function lint_message takes node input converts customized message.
