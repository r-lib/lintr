This vignette describes the steps necessary to create a new linter.

A good example of a simple linter is the `assignment_linter`.
```r
#' @describeIn linters Check that '<-' is always used for assignment.
#' @export
assignment_linter <- function() {
  Linter(function(source_file) {
    lapply(
      ids_with_token(source_file, "EQ_ASSIGN"),
      function(id) {
        parsed <- source_file$parsed_content[id, ]
        Lint(
          filename = source_file$filename,
          line_number = parsed$line1,
          column_number = parsed$col1,
          type = "style",
          message = "Use <-, not =, for assignment.",
          line = source_file$lines[parsed$line1]
        )
      }
    )
  })
}
```

Let us walk through the parts of the linter individually.

## Writing the linter ##
```r
#' @describeIn linters  Check that '<-' is always used for assignment.
#' @export
```
The first two lines add the linter to the `linters` documentation and export it
for use outside the package.

```r
assignment_linter <- function() {
```
Next, we define the name of the new linter.  The convention is to suffix all
linter names with `_linter`. All `_linter` functions are getters that return a
closure that will do the actual linting. We could define additional parameters
that are useful for the linter in this function declaration, but
`assignment_linter` requires no additional arguments.

```r
Linter(function(source_file) {
```
This is the closure. It will be called on the `source_file` variable that
contains the top level expressions in the file to be linted. The call to
`Linter()` simply gives this closure the class 'linter'.

The raw text of the expression is available from `source_file$content`. However
it is recommended to work with the tokens from `source_file$parsed_content` if
possible, as they are tokenized from the `R` parser. These tokens are obtained
from `parse()` and `getParseData()` calls done prior to calling the new linter.
`getParseData()` returns a `data.frame` with information from the source parse
tree of the file being linted. A list of tokens is available from
[r-source/src/main/gram.y](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/ff1bca2f21aba271d428474f00494eece5c36dd3/src/main/gram.y#L293-L307).

```r
lapply(ids_with_token(source_file, "EQ_ASSIGN"),
  function(id) {
    parsed <- with_id(source_file, id)
```
`ids_with_token()` is used to search for a token of a specific type and return
the associated `id`.  Note that `rownames()` for `parsed_content` returns this
`id`, so you can retrieve the rows for a given id with
`source_file$parsed_content[id, ]`. The same operation may be more conveniently
carried out with `with_id(source_file, id)`.

```r
Lint(
  filename = source_file$filename,
  line_number = parsed$line1,
  column_number = parsed$col1,
  type = "style",
  message = "Use <-, not =, for assignment.",
  line = source_file$lines[parsed$line1]
)
```
Lastly, build a `lint` object which describes the issue.  See `?Lint` for a
description of the arguments. You do not have to return a lint for every
iteration of your loop.  Feel free to return `NULL` or `list()` for tokens which
do not need to be linted. You can even return a `list` of `lint` objects if
more than one lint was found.

## Writing linter tests ##
The `linter` package uses [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat) for
testing. You can run all of the currently available tests using
`devtools::test()`.  If you want to run only the tests in a given file use the
`filter` argument to `devtools::test()`.

Linter tests should be put in the
[tests/testthat/](https://github.com/r-lib/lintr/tree/master/tests/testthat)
folder.  The test filename should be the linter name prefixed by `test-`, e.g.
`test-assignment_linter.R`.

The first line in the test file should be a line which defines the context of
the text (the linter name).
```r
context("assignment_linter")
```

You can then specify one or more `test_that` functions.  Most of the linters
use the same default form.
```r
test_that("returns the correct linting", {
```
You then test a series of expectations for the linter using `expect_lint`.
Please see `?expect_lint` for a full description of the parameters.

The main three aspects to test are:

1. Linter returns no lints when there is nothing to lint, e.g.

```r
expect_lint("blah", NULL, assignment_linter())
```

2. Linter returns a lint when there is something to lint, e.g.

```r
expect_lint("blah=1",
  rex("Use <-, not =, for assignment."),
  assignment_linter())
```

3. As many edge cases as you can think of that might break it, e.g.

```r
expect_lint("fun((blah = fun(1)))",
  rex("Use <-, not =, for assignment."),
  assignment_linter())
```

You should also test that the linter belongs to the right class, e.g.

```r
expect_is(assignment_linter(), "linter")
```

You may want to test that additional `lint` attributes are correct,
such as the type, line number, column number, e.g.

```r
expect_lint("blah=1",
  list(message = "assignment", line_number = 1, column_number = 5, type = "style"),
  assignment_linter())
```

Finally, it is a good idea to test that your linter reports multiple lints if
needed, e.g.
```r
expect_lint("blah=1; blah=2",
  list(
    list(line_number = 1, column_number = 5),
    list(line_number = 1, column_number = 13),
  )
  assignment_linter())
```

It is always better to write too many tests rather than too few.

## Adding your linter to the default_linters ##
If your linter is non-project specific you can add it to `default_linters`.
This object is created in the file `zzz.R`.  The name ensures that it will always run after all
the linters are defined.  Simply add your linter name to the `default_linters`
list before the `NULL` at the end.

Push your changes to a branch of your fork of the
[lintr](https://github.com/r-lib/lintr) repository, and submit a pull
request to get your linter merged into lintr!
