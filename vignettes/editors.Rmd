## RStudio

lintr lints are automatically displayed in the RStudio Markers pane (RStudio versions \> v0.99.206).

![RStudio Example](http://i.imgur.com/PIKnpbn.png "Rstudio Example")

In order to show the "Markers" pane in RStudio: Menu "Tools" -\> "Global Options...", a window with title "Options" will pop up.
In that window: click "Code" on the left; click "Diagnostics" tab; check "Show diagnostics for R".

To lint a source file `test.R` type in the Console `lintr::lint("test.R")` and look at the result in the "Markers" pane.

This package also includes two addins for linting the current source and package.
To bind the addin to a keyboard shortcut navigate to Tools \> addins \> Browse Addins \> Keyboard Shortcuts.
It's recommended to use Alt+Shift+L for linting the current source lint and Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L to code the package.
These are easy to remember as you are Alt+Shift+L(int) ;)

## Emacs

lintr has [built-in integration](http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html#r) with [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) versions greater than `0.23`.
![Emacs Example](http://i.imgur.com/vquPht3.gif "Emacs Example")

### Installation

lintr is fully integrated into flycheck when using [ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/).
See the installation documentation for those packages for more information.

### Configuration

You can also configure what linters are used.
e.g. using a different line length cutoff.
- `M-x customize-option` -\> `flycheck-lintr-linters` -\> `linters_with_defaults(line_length_linter(120))`

## Vim - syntastic

lintr can be integrated with [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic) for on-the-fly linting.

![Vim Example](http://i.imgur.com/fR6Os5M.gif "Vim Example")

### Installation

Put the file [syntastic/lintr.vim](inst/syntastic/lintr.vim) in `syntastic/syntax_checkers/r`.
If you are using [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) this directory is `~/.vim/bundles/syntastic/syntax_checkers/r`.

You will also need to add the following lines to your `.vimrc`.

``` vim
let g:syntastic_enable_r_lintr_checker = 1
let g:syntastic_r_checkers = ['lintr']
```

### Configuration

You can also configure what linters are used.
e.g. using a different line length cutoff.

``` vim
let g:syntastic_r_lintr_linters = "linters_with_defaults(line_length_linter(120))"
```

## Vim - ALE

lintr can be integrated with [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) for on the fly linting.

### Installation

lintr is integrated with ALE and requires no additional installation.

### Configuration

You can configure what linters are used, e.g. using a different line length cutoff.

``` vim
let g:ale_r_lintr_options = "linters_with_defaults(line_length_linter(120))"
```

You can also configure whether `lint` or `lint_package` is used.
Set to 1 for `lint_package` and 0 (default) for `lint`.

``` vim
let g:ale_r_lintr_lint_package = 1
```

See `:h ale_r_lintr` for more information.

Note that configuration through `.lintr` files are not supported.

## Sublime Text 3

          "linters": "linters_with_defaults(assignment_linter = NULL, line_length_linter(120))"
