  dotted.case, lowerCamelCalse, UpperCamelCase, alllowercase or ALLUPPERCASE
  (#59, @fangly).
* Deprecated absolute_paths_linter() in favor of the new absolute_path_linter(),

  (@fangly).

  i.e. 1 instead of 1L (@fangly).

  (interactive use) (@fangly).
* Undesirable_operator_linter() and undesirable_function_linter() lint uses of
  user-specified functions and operators (#48, #149, @fangly).

  and do not consider "-" an R operator to avoid too many false positives.

  (#76, #108, #136, #191, #194, #201, @fangly).
