# lintr (development version)

* Updated R CMD GitHub Actions workflow to check for R 3.6 on Ubuntu, instead of R 3.3, and for R 4.0 on Windows, instead of R 3.6 (#803, @ dragosmg)
* Added a secondary, more restrictive lint workflow - `lint-changed-files` - for newly written / modified code (#641, @dragosmg) 
* Switched CI from Travis to GitHub Actions, using the full tidyverse recommended R CMD check. Code coverage and linting 
  are implemented using separate GitHub Actions workflows (#572, @dragosmg)
* `save_cache` will now recursively create the cache directory; this avoids errors that could arise if any parent 
  directories do not exist (#60, @dankessler).
* `extract_r_source` handles Rmd containing unevaluated code blocks with named
  format specifiers (#472, @russHyde)
* New style SNAKE_CASE for `object_name_linter()` (#494, @AshesITR)
* RStudio source markers are cleared when there are no lints (#520, @AshesITR)
* New `assignment_spaces()` lintr. (#538, @f-ritter)
* `seq_linter()`'s lint message is clearer about the reason for linting. (#522, @michaelchirico)
* New `missing_package_linter()` (#536, #547, @renkun-ken)
* New `namespace_linter()` (#548, #551, @renkun-ken)
* Fix possible error on invalid XML produced by xmlparsedata (#559, #560, @renkun-ken)
* Fix handling zero-length variable name error (#566, #567, @renkun-ken)
* New `missing_argument_linter()` (#563, #565, @renkun-ken)
* New `sprintf_linter()` (#544, #578, #624, #625, @renkun-ken, @AshesITR)
* Exclusions specified in the `.lintr` file are now relative to the location of that file 
  and support excluding entire directories (#158, #438, @AshesITR)
* `lint_dir()` excludes the `renv` and `packrat` directories by default (#697, @AshesITR)
* `object_name_linter()` now excludes special R hook functions such as `.onLoad` 
  (#500, #614, @AshesITR and @michaelchirico)
* Improved generic detection for `object_name_linter()` (#737, @AshesITR)
* `equals_na_linter()` now lints `x != NA` and `NA == x`, and skips usages in comments (#545, @michaelchirico)
* Malformed Rmd files now cause a lint instead of an error (#571, #575, @AshesITR)
* `object_name_linter()` gains a new default style, `"symbols"`, which won't lint all-symbol object names 
  (in particular, that means operator names like `%+%` are skipped; #495, #615, #670, @michaelchirico and @AshesITR)
* `spaces_inside_linter` ignores spaces preceding trailing comments (#636, @michaelchirico)
* `T_and_F_symbol_linter` and `semicolon_terminator_linter` are now part of the default linters
  (#517, #612, #683, #684, @AshesITR)
* `with_defaults()` no longer duplicates the `lintr_function` class when it is already present (#511, #612, @AshesITR)
* New `backport_linter()` for detecting mismatched R version dependencies (#506, @MichaelChirico)
* `paren_brace_linter` and `no_tab_linter` also use more reliable matching (e.g.,
  excluding matches found in comments; #441 and #545, @russHyde)
* `paren_brace_linter` now marks lints at the opening brace instead of the closing parenthesis, making fixing the lints
  by jumping to source markers easier (#583, @AshesITR)
* Lints are now marked with the name of the `linter` that caused them instead of the name of their implementation
  function.    
  Deprecated the obsolete `linter` argument of `Lint()`. (#664, #673, #746, @AshesITR)
* New syntax to exclude only selected linters from linting lines or passages. Use `# nolint: linter_name, linter2_name.`
  or `# nolint start: linter_name, linter2_name.` in source files or named lists of line numbers in `.lintr`.
  (#660, @AshesITR)
* Fixed `spaces_left_parentheses_linter` sporadically causing warnings (#654, #674, @AshesITR)
* Fixed `line_length_linter` causing duplicate lints for lines containing multiple expressions (#681, #682, @AshesITR)
* `line_length_linter` now places the source marker at the margin of the affected line to improve user experience during 
  de-linting -- just press <kbd>Return</kbd> (#735, @AshesITR)
* `unneeded_concatenation_linter` now correctly considers arguments piped in via magrittr `%>%` (#573, #585, @michaelquinn32)
* Set the default `complexity_limit` in `cyclocomp_linter` to 15. This is the same complexity limit that is enforced via
  `default_linters` (#693, #695, @AshesITR).
* `lint_package()` now lints files in the `demo` directory by default (#703, @dmurdoch).
* `object_usage_linter()` now correctly detects global variables if there are top-level dollar-assignments (#666, #709, @AshesITR)
* `commented_code_linter()` uses the parse tree to find comments, eliminating some false positives (#451, @AshesITR)
* `trailing_blank_lines_linter()` now also lints files without a terminal newline (#675, @AshesITR)
* `object_name_linter()` now correctly detects imported functions when linting packages (#642, @AshesITR)
* Consistent access to linters through a function call, even for linters without parameters (#245, @fangly, @AshesITR, and @MichaelChirico)
* `object_usage_linter()` now correctly reports usage warnings spanning multiple lines (#507, @AshesITR)
* `T_and_F_symbol_linter()` no longer lints occurrences of `T` and `F` when used for subsetting and gives a better 
  message when used as variable names (#657, @AshesITR)
* `with_defaults()` handles automatic naming of very long arguments correctly (#774, @michaelchirico)
* `object_name_linter()` no longer lints names used for subsetting (#582, @AshesITR)
* `lint_package()` warns and returns `NULL` if no package is found (instead of giving a peculiar error message) (#776, @michaelchirico)
* `lint_package()` is also stricter about what it considers to be a package -- folders named `DESCRIPTION` are ignored (#702, @michaelchirico)
* `lint()` now has a new optional argument `text` for supplying a string or lines directly, e.g. if the file is already in memory or linting is being done ad hoc. (#503, @renkun-ken)
* New `pipe_call_linter()` enforces that all steps of `magrittr` pipelines use explicit calls instead of symbols, e.g. `x %>% mean()` instead of `x %>% mean` (@michaelchirico)
* `get_source_expressions()` no longer fails if `getParseData()` returns a truncated (invalid) Unicode character as parsed text (#815, #816, @leogama)
* lintr now supports non-system character Encodings. Auto-detects the correct encoding from .Rproj or DESCRIPTION 
  files in your project. Override the default in the `encoding` setting of lintr. (#752, #782, @AshesITR)

# lintr 2.0.1

  tokens arising when parsing code containing equals-assignments in R-devel
  (#403, #456, @russHyde).

  fall-through in a switch statement (#499, @MrMallIronmaker)
